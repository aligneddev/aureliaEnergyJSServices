# aureliaEnergyJSServices

Aurelia implementation of the energy app using [JavaScriptServices](https://github.com/aspnet/JavaScriptServices) which uses .Net Core.
Read [Building Single Page Applications on ASP.NET Core with JavaScriptServices](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2017/02/14/building-single-page-applications-on-asp-net-core-with-javascriptservices/) for more details.

See [my main project](https://github.com/aligneddev/JQueryToAurelia) with an implementation using the Aurelia skeleton (though that may be removed in favor of this one).
